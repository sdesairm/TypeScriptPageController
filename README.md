# TypeScriptPageController
Page Controller implementation using Typescript and Web API

This is an implementation of PageController Pattern using Typescript and dotnet core. Dotnet core is used to render the initial page from the server and can be replaced with any other technology such as NodeJs.

The Pagecontroller pattern has one main page with layout and the subsequent pages are loaded as subpages. The subpages are defined in pagenavigation.json file. 

Few links to reference the pattern.
